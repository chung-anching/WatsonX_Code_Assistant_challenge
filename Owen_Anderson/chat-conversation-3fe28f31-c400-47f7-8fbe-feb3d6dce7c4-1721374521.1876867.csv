system,"Hi **Anderson Chung**, welcome to WCA@IBM ðŸ‘‹! I'm your trusty assistant, here to answer your questions, provide explanations, and even generate code. So, go ahead and start chatting with me below!

You can also do some other really cool things! For example, highlight a piece of code and:

- Explain Code Snippet: `âŒ¥+Q E` (Mac) or `Alt+Q E` (Windows)
- Generate Documentation: `âŒ¥+Q S` or `Alt+Q S`
- Generate Unit Tests: `âŒ¥+Q T` or `Alt+Q T`

Just like you ðŸ˜Š, I am not perfect, so surprises and mistakes are possible. Please verify any generated code or suggestions, and modify as needed. Let's get started!",,,2024-07-19 07:35:19.312004,
